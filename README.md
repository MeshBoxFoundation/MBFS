## What is MBFS?

MBFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem which developed on the base of IPFS. It combines good ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web. It is like a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. MBFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs.
